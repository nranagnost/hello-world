Repository configured to learn about GitHub

Hello, world! I currently live in Pheonix, AZ. I've been working in education technology for the past 8 years. While my focus has been more on the business side of things, I have been exposed quiite a bit to the tech/dev world. The more I learn about development, the more I am interested in pursuing it as a possible career move. I am taking the CS50 course to further explore software dev. My name is Nick Anagnost and this is CS50.
